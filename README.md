# Computational Discovery and Optimization of High-Efficacy CRISPR-Cas13b Guide RNAs for Broad-Spectrum Dengue Targeting

This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end computational pipeline for designing **high-efficacy CRISPR-Cas13b guide RNAs (crRNAs)** targeting all four **Dengue Virus (DENV)** serotypes.  

The workflow integrates:

- Large-scale viral genome processing  
- Conservation-aware 30-nt spacer extraction  
- Cas13b-specific biochemical sequence optimization  
- Classical ML-based efficiency prediction  
- Benchmarking with foundation model embeddings  

This project establishes one of the first **Cas13b-focused computational design pipelines**, producing **ranked, experimentally informed crRNA candidates** ready for validation.
